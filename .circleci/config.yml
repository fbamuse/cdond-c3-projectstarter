### It's a good practice to keep your commands at the top of the config file. In this project, you'll need at least 2 commands:

# commands:
#   destroy-environment:
#     description: Destroy backend and frontend cloudformation stacks given a workflow ID.
#     ...

#   revert-migration:
#     description: Revert the last migration if successfully run in the current workflow.
#     ...

jobs:

  build-frontend:
    environment:
      CODE: 123
    docker:
      - image:  circleci/node:13.8.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:
          keys: [frontend-build]
      - run:
          name: build frontend
          command: |
            cd frontend
            echo $CODE
            npm insrall
            npm run build
      - save_cache:
          path: [ frontend/node_modules]
          key: frontend-build
